> A friend of mine said that if I put this file into Google Earth, it'll bring me to his favorite animal from the rainforests of Southeast Asia. I'll take his word for it. The flag is the animal's scientific name, with an underscore instead of a space.

Look up what program takes a `.kml` file yields Google Earth. Import `animal.kml` into Google Earth brings us to a bearcat statue. Look up the scientific name of a bearcat and we're done.
