I used the Google Images search by image feature to see if the given file was posted anywhere. This produced a few results similar to what we were looking for.

The first link I tried was a blog post [here](https://homesweetdreaming.com/2014/11/20/christmas-inspiration-in-stylish-zurich/). The website was down when I tried to access it, so I pasted the link into the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. This revealed the post which talked about a visit to the Swiss National Museum.
